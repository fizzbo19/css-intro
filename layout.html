	<p class='description'> Dog fighting as a ‘sport’ was banned in 1835, as even then it was considered barbaric. But this horrific form of dog abuse still goes on. Forcing dogs to fight each other is a devastating betrayal of the trust that dogs put in humans. Training methods which brutalise the dogs and the fights themselves inflict untold physical and mental suffering on ‘man’s best friend’.</p>
